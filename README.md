# MultiplayerGame
This repository contains the Program of Online Multiplayer Game Project in Operating System(Course Code-CSE 316).
According to the problem given, we have to make a program which is known as multiplayer online game. This Online multiplayer game has following constraints: Only one server is given, the match will start only if there are exact 3 players(If more than 3 players then players have to wait till the match end). The new match can start only when previous match has finished.

This problem is solved by the Semaphore concept of Operating System and other basic concepts of C language. Semaphore is a simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section problem and to achieve process synchronization in the multi-processing environment. Semaphore tool does not  require busy waiting.
